# Conclusion
Our project explores the key factors into traffic collisions, showing the distribution of crash types, collision types, traffic controls, and route types, and we also focus on discovering the relationship of these categories. The result reveals that same-direction and single-vehicle collisions are the most prevalent, often occurring on state and county roads. Uncontrolled intersections and higher speed limits were identified as major contributors to severe crashes, while rush hours and lighting conditions further influenced collision patterns. We consider the lack of continuous data is the major limitation, because it limits the availability of various graphs. Moreover, missing data in the dataset also constrain our visualization. Future directions should focus on improving the dataset quality, including adding new variables like weather, temperature, car speed before crashes, and utilizing models to identify high-risk scenarios. Our key lessons learned are the importance of data granularity, the methods to conduct data visualization on categorical data with multiple dimensions, and the role of exploratory data visualization and analysis in identifying traffic safety issues.

Based on our findings, we recommend the official to improve infrastructure to ensure road safety. Adding traffic controls, such as stop signs, yield signs, or traffic signals to high-risk intersections to reduce the crashes in un-controlled roads. Installing street lights on poorly lit roads to improve the visibility, as night light conditions have higher fatal crash rates. Additionally, deploying more patrolling police officers during rush hour can ensure quicker responses to incidents. These interventions collectively address critical risk factors and can lead to safer roadways for all users.
