    "text": "1 Introduction\nTraffic accidents are a significant concern for public safety and urban planning across the globe. Every year, thousands of lives are lost, and countless others are affected by injuries, property damage, and emotional trauma due to traffic collisions. The dataset includes information over 180,000 traffic accidents in Maryland State, and provides detailed information about motor vehicle operators. The dataset is derived from the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS) of the Maryland State Police and includes preliminary and verified data reported by multiple law enforcement agencies. It records a wide array of details for each collision, offering a valuable resource for analyzing traffic safety issues.\nThis project focuses on exploring the factors contributing to traffic collisions, which affect all road users—drivers, pedestrians, and passengers. By analyzing crash types, temporal trends, environmental conditions, and road characteristics, the study seeks to uncover patterns that influence accident outcomes, including property damage and injuries. As technologies such as automated safety systems and driverless cars become more prevalent, understanding these factors can also highlight areas requiring regulatory or technological improvements. Leveraging data from Maryland’s diverse roadways, this analysis examines variables such as light conditions, traffic controls, speed limits, and collision types, while considering seasonal, temporal, and route-specific variations. The findings aim to provide actionable insights for improving road safety and guiding data-driven traffic policies.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe Crash Reporting - Drivers Data is the primary dataset for this project, maintained by the Maryland State Police through the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS). This dataset is collected through traffic accident reports submitted by law enforcement agencies, including the Montgomery County Police, Gaithersburg Police, Takoma Park Police Department, and Rockville Police Department. Provided in CSV format, the dataset contains 188,090 rows and 39 columns, with each row representing a unique traffic collision event. Key columns for analysis include ACRS Report Type, Crash Date/Time, Light, Route Type, Collision Type, Traffic Control, and Speed Limit. This dynamic dataset is updated weekly, reflecting new crash reports joined with related datasets. The scope of the data focuses on traffic collisions within Montgomery County, Maryland, capturing details such as crash types, road types, environmental conditions, and traffic controls. However, some fields, like Traffic Control and Route Type, contain missing values, and preliminary reports may have inconsistencies that could impact analysis. The dataset will be imported using Python’s pandas library, with preprocessing steps including column filtering, handling missing values, and grouping time fields into categories like morning, afternoon, and evening. The dataset is publicly available on the Montgomery County Open Data Portal at this link [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crash-reporting-drivers-data].",

In contrast, the remaining four columns—route type, collision type, light, and traffic control—contain varying degrees of missing data. To analyze the missing values, we generated a bar chart and a heatmap. The bar chart reveals that traffic control has the highest percentage of missing data at approximately 14.3%. This suggests a potential issue in data collection or entry for this field, highlighting significant incompleteness. The second-highest missing rate is observed in route type (9.8%), which similarly points to possible gaps in data input processes. In comparison, light and collision type exhibit minimal missingness, at 0.8% and 0.3% respectively, reflecting a relatively high level of data completeness for these fields. The heatmap further illustrates the relationships between missing data across columns. A notable correlation exists between missing values in traffic control and route type, suggesting that when one of these columns has missing data, the other is also likely to be incomplete. In contrast, light and collision type show little to no correlation with missing data in other columns, indicating that their missingness is likely independent. In conclusion, the dataset has a low overall percentage of missing data, and correlations between missing values across columns are generally weak. This indicates that missing data is neither widespread nor systematically interdependent, simplifying both its analysis and potential imputation strategies.",

    "text": "3.1 Understanding Collision and Route Types\nTo start, we explore the overall distribution of collision types to understand the major categories of traffic incidents.

The most frequent collision type is same direction collisions, followed by single vehicle collisions. Less common types include turning collisions, front/rear collisions and opposite direction collisions. A notable portion of collisions is categorized as unknown, which may require further investigation or clarification. This distribution highlights that many crashes involve vehicles traveling in the same direction, emphasizing potential issues such as tailgating or lane changes.\nNext, we examine the types of routes where these collisions occur most frequently. By linking collision types to specific route categories, we gain insights into the environments contributing to these incidents.\nCode\n# Bar Plot (Frequency of Route Types)\ncrash2_data &lt;- read.csv(\"crash2.csv\")\ncrash2_summary &lt;- crash2_data %&gt;%\n  filter(Light %in% c(\"daylight\", \"dark lights on\", \"dark no lights\", \"dusk\", \"dawn\")) %&gt;% # Select relevant light conditions\n  count(Light, ACRS.Report.Type) # Count occurrences by light and report type\n\n\n# Define custom color scheme\ncolors_for_route_type &lt;- c(\n  \"unknown\" = \"#FF7F00\",                 # Orange\n  \"maryland (state)\" = \"#E377C2\",       # Yellow\n  \"county\" = \"#66C2A5\",                  # Teal\n  \"municipality\" = \"#8DA0CB\",            # Mauve\n  \"interstate (state)\" = \"#2CA02C\",      # Dark Green\n  \"us (state)\" = \"#E6550D\",              # Burnt Orange\n  \"other public roadway\" = \"#A63603\",    # Brick Red\n  \"government\" = \"#08519C\",              # Navy Blue\n  \"ramp\" = \"#17BECF\",                    # Dark Cyan\n  \"service road\" = \"#8C564B\",            # Maroon\n  \"municipality route\" = \"#D62728\",      # Magenta\n  \"spur\" = \"#6A51A3\",                    # Slate Blue\n  \"local route\" = \"#228B22\",             # Forest Green\n  \"bicycle route\" = \"#663399\",           # Dark Purple\n  \"private route\" = \"#FFFF33\",           # Bright Pink\n  \"crossover\" = \"#BDB76B\"                # Dark Yellow\n)\n\n# Count occurrences of each Route.Type in crash2_data\nroute_counts &lt;- crash2_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(Route.Type) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Count))\n\n# Create the bar graph with custom color scheme\nggplot(route_counts, aes(x = reorder(Route.Type, -Count), y = Count, fill = Route.Type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE, width = 0.7) +  # Narrow bars for better distinction\n  geom_text(aes(label = Count), vjust = -0.5, size = 4, color = \"black\") +  # Add labels on top of each bar\n  labs(\n    title = \"Count of Route Types\",\n    x = \"Route Type\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, max(route_counts$Count) * 1.1)) +  # Add space for labels\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors_for_route_type) +  # Use custom colors\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),  # Rotate x-axis labels\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\nThis bar chart illustrates the distribution of traffic collisions across different route types. The most common route types are Maryland (state) and county roads, which together account for a majority of the reported collisions. Unknown route types also make up a significant portion, indicating missing or unclear data. Other route types, such as municipality roads, US (state) roads, and interstate highways, have lower counts but still contribute meaningfully to the overall distribution. These findings highlight that state and county roads are the primary locations for traffic incidents, emphasizing the importance of focusing safety measures and traffic management efforts on these areas.\nTo combine these insights, we explore how specific collision types vary across different route types. This visualization reveals patterns unique to certain routes, such as the dominance of ‘single vehicle collisions’ on rural roads or ‘front/rear collisions’ on urban streets.\nCode\n# Bar Plot (Collision Types faceted by Route Type)\n# Define updated custom color scheme\ncolors_for_route_type &lt;- c(\n  \"unknown\" = \"#FF7F00\",                 # Orange\n  \"maryland (state)\" = \"#E377C2\",        # Bright Pink\n  \"county\" = \"#66C2A5\",                  # Teal\n  \"municipality\" = \"#8DA0CB\",            # Mauve\n  \"interstate (state)\" = \"#2CA02C\",      # Dark Green\n  \"us (state)\" = \"#E6550D\",              # Burnt Orange\n  \"other public roadway\" = \"#A63603\",    # Brick Red\n  \"government\" = \"#08519C\",              # Navy Blue\n  \"ramp\" = \"#17BECF\",                    # Dark Cyan\n  \"service road\" = \"#8C564B\",            # Maroon\n  \"municipality route\" = \"#D62728\",      # Magenta\n  \"spur\" = \"#6A51A3\",                    # Slate Blue\n  \"local route\" = \"#228B22\",             # Forest Green\n  \"bicycle route\" = \"#663399\",           # Dark Purple\n  \"private route\" = \"#FFFF33\",           # Yellow\n  \"crossover\" = \"#BDB76B\"                # Dark Yellow\n)\n\n# Prepare data, sort Route.Type by Collision.Count in descending order within each Collision.Type\ncollision_summary &lt;- car_crash |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(Route.Type), !is.na(Collision.Type)) |&gt; \n  group_by(Route.Type, Collision.Type) |&gt; \n  summarize(Collision.Count = n(), .groups = 'drop') |&gt; \n  arrange(Collision.Type, desc(Collision.Count))\n\n# Reorder Route.Type within each Collision.Type\ncollision_summary$Route.Type &lt;- factor(collision_summary$Route.Type, \n                                       levels = unique(collision_summary$Route.Type))\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(collision_summary, aes(x = Route.Type, y = Collision.Count, fill = Route.Type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Collision Types by Route Type\",\n    x = \"Route Type\",\n    y = \"Number of Collisions\",\n    fill = \"Route Type\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors_for_route_type) +  # Use the custom color scheme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = \"bold\")\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Collision.Type, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 4)\nThe Maryland (state) category and county category exhibit the highest number of collisions across nearly all types, including single vehicle collisions, head-on collisions, and same direction collisions, suggesting that local roads are particularly prone to accidents. This pattern may result from higher traffic volumes, frequent stops, or more complex navigation on local roads. County roads also account for a significant number of collisions, especially single vehicle collisions and same direction collisions, though the majority of collisions still occur on local routes. Notably, opposite direction collisions are predominantly observed on county routes, which are often characterized by two-lane undivided structures and higher speed limits, increasing the risk of head-on crashes. This emphasizes the need for targeted safety measures such as centerline rumble strips, enhanced signage, and improved road design to reduce risks on county roads. Collisions under the “unknown” category are disproportionately high on unknown route types, suggesting potential issues in data collection or reporting that could hinder the accurate analysis of trends. In contrast, bicycle routes, spurs, service roads, and private roads report the lowest collision counts, likely reflecting lower usage or dedicated infrastructure for these road types. These findings highlight the importance of prioritizing safety interventions and infrastructure improvements, particularly on local and county roads where collisions are most prevalent.",

Traffic signals are the second common incidents, indicating that while they regulate traffic, they remain accident-prone due to possible human or mechanical errors. Stop signs also contributed to crashes but at a much lower frequency. Other measures, such as flashing signals and yield signs, showed minimal crash counts, suggesting either limited usage or greater effectiveness. This analysis emphasizes the need for enhanced safety measures, especially in uncontrolled areas, to reduce accidents and improve road safety for all users.\nBefore analyzing the influence of traffic controls on crash outcomes, we take a closer look at the overall distribution of crash types. This provides essential context for understanding how different crash severities are impacted by traffic management.\n\n\nCode\n# Bar Plot (Frequency of Car Crash Types)\n\ncar_crash_counts &lt;- car_crash |&gt;\n  group_by(ACRS.Report.Type) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Count))\n\ncolors_for_crash_type &lt;- c(\n  \"fatal crash\" = \"#CC7A8B\",\n  \"injury crash\" = \"#7FBF7F\", \n  \"property damage crash\" = \"#89CFF0\"\n)\nggplot(car_crash_counts, aes(x = reorder(ACRS.Report.Type, -Count), y = Count, fill = ACRS.Report.Type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors_for_crash_type) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Frequency of Crash Types\",\n    x = \"Crash Type\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar plot visualizes the distribution of crash types in the dataset, categorized into three main types: property damage crashes, injury crashes, and fatal crashes. The plot reveals that property damage crashes are the most frequent, significantly outnumbering the other two types. Injury crashes are the second most common, while fatal crashes occur relatively infrequently. The stark difference in counts highlights the prevalence of less severe accidents compared to life-threatening or fatal incidents. This foundational analysis provides critical context for further exploration into the factors that influence crash severity.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of traffic controls, we explore their relationship with crash severity. This mosaic plot highlights how the presence of stop signs or traffic signals correlates with fewer severe crashes.",

    "text": "Our project explores the key factors into traffic collisions, showing the distribution of crash types, collision types, traffic controls, and route types, and we also focus on discovering the relationship of these categories. The result reveals that same-direction and single-vehicle collisions are the most prevalent, often occurring on state and county roads. Uncontrolled intersections and higher speed limits were identified as major contributors to severe crashes, while rush hours and lighting conditions further influenced collision patterns. We consider the lack of continuous data is the major limitation, because it limits the availability of various graphs. Moreover, missing data in the dataset also constrain our visualization. Future directions should focus on improving the dataset quality, including adding new variables like weather, temperature, car speed before crashes, and utilizing models to identify high-risk scenarios. Our key lessons learned are the importance of data granularity, the methods to conduct data visualization on categorical data with multiple dimensions, and the role of exploratory data visualization and analysis in identifying traffic safety issues.\nBased on our findings, we recommend the official to improve infrastructure to ensure road safety. Adding traffic controls, such as stop signs, yield signs, or traffic signals to high-risk intersections to reduce the crashes in un-controlled roads.
