    "text": "1 Introduction\nTraffic accidents are a significant concern for public safety and urban planning across the globe. Every year, thousands of lives are lost, and countless others are affected by injuries, property damage, and emotional trauma due to traffic collisions. The dataset includes information over 180,000 traffic accidents in Maryland State, and provides detailed information about motor vehicle operators. The dataset is derived from the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS) of the Maryland State Police and includes preliminary and verified data reported by multiple law enforcement agencies. It records a wide array of details for each collision, offering a valuable resource for analyzing traffic safety issues.\nThis project focuses on exploring the factors contributing to traffic collisions, which affect all road users—drivers, pedestrians, and passengers. By analyzing crash types, temporal trends, environmental conditions, and road characteristics, the study seeks to uncover patterns that influence accident outcomes, including property damage and injuries. As technologies such as automated safety systems and driverless cars become more prevalent, understanding these factors can also highlight areas requiring regulatory or technological improvements. Leveraging data from Maryland’s diverse roadways, this analysis examines variables such as light conditions, traffic controls, speed limits, and collision types, while considering seasonal, temporal, and route-specific variations. The findings aim to provide actionable insights for improving road safety and guiding data-driven traffic policies.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe Crash Reporting - Drivers Data is the primary dataset for this project, maintained by the Maryland State Police through the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS). This dataset is collected through traffic accident reports submitted by law enforcement agencies, including the Montgomery County Police, Gaithersburg Police, Takoma Park Police Department, and Rockville Police Department. Provided in CSV format, the dataset contains 188,090 rows and 39 columns, with each row representing a unique traffic collision event. Key columns for analysis include ACRS Report Type, Crash Date/Time, Light, Route Type, Collision Type, Traffic Control, and Speed Limit. This dynamic dataset is updated weekly, reflecting new crash reports joined with related datasets. The scope of the data focuses on traffic collisions within Montgomery County, Maryland, capturing details such as crash types, road types, environmental conditions, and traffic controls. However, some fields, like Traffic Control and Route Type, contain missing values, and preliminary reports may have inconsistencies that could impact analysis. The dataset will be imported using Python’s pandas library, with preprocessing steps including column filtering, handling missing values, and grouping time fields into categories like morning, afternoon, and evening. The dataset is publicly available on the Montgomery County Open Data Portal at this link [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crash-reporting-drivers-data].",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nWe primarily focused on the following columns: report number, ACRS report type, crash date time, route type, collision type, light, traffic control, and speed limit. Among these, four columns—report number, ACRS report type, crash date time, and speed limit—have no missing data, indicating consistent and complete data collection. In contrast, the remaining four columns—route type, collision type, light, and traffic control—contain varying degrees of missing data. To analyze the missing values, we generated a bar chart and a heatmap. The bar chart reveals that traffic control has the highest percentage of missing data at approximately 14.3%. This suggests a potential issue in data collection or entry for this field, highlighting significant incompleteness. The second-highest missing rate is observed in route type (9.8%), which similarly points to possible gaps in data input processes. In comparison, light and collision type exhibit minimal missingness, at 0.8% and 0.3% respectively, reflecting a relatively high level of data completeness for these fields. The heatmap further illustrates the relationships between missing data across columns. A notable correlation exists between missing values in traffic control and route type, suggesting that when one of these columns has missing data, the other is also likely to be incomplete. In contrast, light and collision type show little to no correlation with missing data in other columns, indicating that their missingness is likely independent. In conclusion, the dataset has a low overall percentage of missing data, and correlations between missing values across columns are generally weak. This indicates that missing data is neither widespread nor systematically interdependent, simplifying both its analysis and potential imputation strategies.",
