# Introduction


Traffic accidents are a significant concern for public safety and urban planning across the globe. Every year, thousands of lives are lost, and countless others are affected by injuries, property damage, and emotional trauma due to traffic collisions. The dataset includes information over 180,000 traffic accidents in Maryland State, and provides detailed information about motor vehicle operators. The dataset is derived from the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS) of the Maryland State Police and includes preliminary and verified data reported by multiple law enforcement agencies. It records a wide array of details for each collision, offering a valuable resource for analyzing traffic safety issues.


We chose this topic because traffic safety impacts everyone—drivers, pedestrians, and passengers alike. Understanding the factors that lead to accidents can help municipalities, policymakers, and traffic authorities develop data-driven strategies to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic collisions. With the increasing integration of technology in vehicles, from automated safety systems to driverless cars, analyzing accident data also highlights areas requiring regulatory or technological improvements. Moreover, Maryland’s diverse roadways, spanning highways, county roads, and municipal streets, present an opportunity to investigate how different environments influence crash outcomes.


This project aims to explore the relationships between various factors contributing to traffic collisions, focusing on how crash types, temporal trends, environmental conditions, and road characteristics interact to influence accident outcomes. By analyzing patterns across light conditions, traffic control types, speed limits, and collision types, the study aims to uncover insights into the circumstances leading to property damage and injury crashes. Additionally, the project will examine how these factors vary across different seasons, times of day, and route types to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics behind traffic accidents. These findings can offer valuable perspectives for improving road safety and informing data-driven traffic policies.
